 * Summary. Manages the loading and estimations of the Hands Network
 * Description. The HandPoseController class is in charge of loading the Hands model,
 *              from the mediapipe hub, and constantly estimate a hands position from the current
 *              frame of the given videoStream. Additionally, every time that a hand is detected,
 *              it executes the set of callbacks passed as argument in the constructor.
